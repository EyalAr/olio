# olio

Synchronized collaborative state editing.  

Use as:

0. A client which syncs with a server.
0. A server which syncs with multiple clients.
0. A client which syncs directly with other clients in a peer-to-peer network.

Peers generate sync requests and sync responses. A sync request contains changes
to state made by peer A which peer B should apply. The response from peer B
contains changes since peer's A last sync.

Based on [Differential Synchronization by Neil Fraser](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/sync/eng047-fraser.pdf).

## API

### State

```Javascript
import State from 'olio';
var State = require('olio').State;
require(['olio/state'], function(State){ /* ... */ });
```

`State` is a constructor which receives an optional JSON object of the initial state.

`var s = new State()`  
`var s = new State(init)`

#### Modifying state

`s.set( keypath, value )`

0. `keypath {String/Array}`
0. `value {*}`

### Sync

```Javascript
import Sync from 'olio';
var Sync = require('olio').Sync;
require(['olio/sync'], function(Sync){ /* ... */ });
```

`Sync` is a constructor which receives a state.

`var sy = new Sync(state)`

### Adding a peer

`sy.addPeer(id);`

0. `id {String}`

### Sync cycles

A sync cycle can be initiated by any peer. Each cycle is made of:

0. A patch is generated by peer A (the initiating peer).
0. The patch is sent to peer B (over the network for example).
0. Peer B applies the patch and generates an answer patch.
0. The answer patch is sent to peer A.
0. Peer A applies the answer patch.

At the end of the cycle both peer have a consistent state; if further changes
were made, a new cycle needs to be executed.

#### Patch peer

`sy.patchPeer(id)`

0. `id {String}`

Generate a patch for the specified peer.

#### Receive a patch

`sy.receive(id, patch, preferRemote)`

0. `id {String}`
0. `Patch {Array}`
0. `preferRemote {Boolean}`

Receive a patch either as an answer or as a cycle request. If a cycle request
this method will return the answer to be sent to the other peer.
